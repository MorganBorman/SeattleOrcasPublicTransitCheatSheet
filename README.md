# Public Transit Seattle/Orcas Cheat-sheet

This cheat-sheet makes it simpler to figure out which busses and ferries actually connect to get between Orcas and Seattle by public transportation. (Obviously, Google maps or your smart phone can do this too, but a paper copy is a nice alternative or backup.)

Since the schedules change periodically - sometimes ahead of their specified expiry dates - this cheat sheet will sometimes be innaccurate. Please exercise due caution when making important plans.
